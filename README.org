#+TITLE: Yt-Com

*Reliable* YouTube comments front-end for Emacs.  Reliable?  Yes.  Invidious
instances are not very reliable.  They go down and fail to respond from time to
time.  This package tries to mitigate this problem by using a *LIST* of
invidious instances.  The more you have, the better.  It sequentially tries to
request data from every invidious instance and returns as soon as it gets a
response without an error.  Neat!

Why only YouTube comments?  Why not a full-blown front-end for YouTube?  Well,
since I discovered that invidious instances work very well with only HTML
enabled, I just use EWW for browsing them.
