#+TITLE: Yt-Com

*Reliable* YouTube comments front-end for Emacs.

* Usage
  There are TWO entry points to this package.  ~yt-com~, which takes a YouTube
  (or Invidious) URL. And, ~yt-com-id~, which takes just a video id.  The latter
  might have a better use from code.  These are interactive commands!

* Reliable?
  Yes, this is what this package tries to achieve.  Invidious instances are not
  very reliable.  They go down and fail to respond from time to time.  This
  package tries to mitigate this problem by using a *LIST* of invidious
  instances.  The more you have, the better.  It sequentially tries to request
  data from every invidious instance and returns as soon as it gets a response
  without an error.  And, of course, it is asynchronous!

* Why only YouTube comments?
  Why not a full-blown front-end for YouTube?  Well, since I discovered that
  invidious instances work very well with only HTML enabled, I just use EWW for
  browsing them.  It dose require JavaScript for comments thou.

* Why not contributing to [[https://github.com/gRastello/ytel][ytel/]][[https://github.com/spiderbit/ytdious][ytdious]] to add reliability?
  Well, because I needed only comments!  And, I don't like adding a dependency
  for what I'm not using.
